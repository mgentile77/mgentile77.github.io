        <div id="about">
            <p>Python was the first language I learned when I returned to school.  
                I quickly embraced it and immediately began finding uses in my projects.  
                The following examples demonstrate a few ways in which I have been able to utilize these skills in my analytics.</p></div>

            <h3>Example 1: The Email Issues</h3>
            <p>At Allegion, I worked as a member of the DevOps team.  
                This team was charged with developing and maintaining the application that drove their manufacturing lines.  
                When this application had potential issues, an error report was saved in the database, 
                and an email was sent out to the developers.  
                I recognized that the emails had data not being stored due to when the email was sent versus when the error report 
                was stored.  This modification to the application was low priority, 
                so I wrote a quick Python script to pull the emails, parse them, and store them in a table.  
                I then developed this report to determine issues affecting the manufacturing lines.  
                It was speculated that network issues were slowing production.  
                However, these issues were later proved to be caused by the ERP's poor archiving practices.  
                This report proved critical in providing evidence for that revelation.</p>

            <h3>Example 2: Jupyter Analysis</h3>
            <p>This project is an example of using Python and Python libraries to clean and analyze a data set.  
                I used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to create a statistical report with graphical visualizations of the data set.  
                The markdowns were used to provide insights into the information discovered.  
                The entire project was completed using only Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
