                <!-- <h3>Recent Work Examples</h3> -->
                <p>Below are a few links to repositories with work I've completed in Tableau, Excel, and Power Point.
                    These repositories contain all the items needed to view my work and processes. 
                </p>

            <h3>Example 1: Excel and Power Point Presentation</h3>
            <p>Excel is by far the program that I have the most experience.  
                I've been using excel for years creating pivots, graphs, and macros.  
                Below is an example of using excel with power query to clean, organize, and analyze data.  
                I then developed the data into a Power Point presentation where the insights are highlighted and easily recognized.  
                Audio was added next, and it was turned into and mp4 for distribution.</p>

                <h3>Example 2: Presentations</h3>
                <p>Next is an an example of a presentation I created and added audio.  
                    This presentation was built using Power Point, but the audio was creaeted and edited using various audio tools.  
                    I became proficient in audio editing and production while developing a podcast with my wife.  
                    Unfortunately, we were not able to keep up with this hobby, but hope to continue our podcast in the near future.  
                    However, the experience did provide the skills necessary to produce a professional and entertaining product.  
                    This example showcases some of those skills and how they can be of use in a different setting.</p>

                    <h3>Example 3: Tableau</h3>
                    <p>I was only able to work with Tableau for a short time, 
                        but was able to develop the skills to earn a certificate in for Tableau design.  
                        In this link you will find two examples of how I was able to build dashboards.  
                        I provide insights and complex drill downs in these reports using data from scraped from websites.</p>
