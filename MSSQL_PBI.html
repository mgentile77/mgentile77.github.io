                <!-- <h3>Recent Work Examples</h3> -->
                <p>Here are some examples of how I can use my SQL skills in MSSQL to optimize queries 
                    and create stunning reports and dashboards on Power BI.  I recently did this for a former employer where
                    these report styles have become a staple for building reports in their MES division.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Example 1: The Production Board</h3>
            <p>Here is an example of a dashboard I built with a direct query 
                I optimized in Power BI to obtain live updates as production occurred.  
                When building the following report, I met with stakeholders to determine what information was important 
                to include and who the report should be created for.  
                I also included branding and paid close attention to color development. </p>
            <div class="project 1">

                <img src="images/Powerbi.allegion.scrnsht.dailyold.png" alt="" height="240" width="440" /></a> </div>
            <div class="project last">
                <h6>After Optimization of SQL and Visualizations</h6>
                <img src="images/Powerbi.allegion.scrnsht.daily.png" alt="" height="240" width="440" /></a> </div>
            <h3>Example 2: Historical Review</h3>
            <p>Next is an example of a report with data duplicated from the previous report.  
                This report is a historical account of production totals and does not require data duplication.  
                Additionally, when the query was run for this report, it took over 20 minutes to complete on a 
                production-critical database and was run every hour.  
                I optimized the query, reducing run time to less than two minutes, 
                and removed the scheduling because stakeholders determined that the report did not need a scheduled refresh.</p>
            <div class="project 1">
                <h6>Before Optimization of SQL and Visualizations</h6>
                <img src="images/Powerbi.allegion.scrnsht.historicalold.png" alt="" height="240" width="440" /></a> </div>
            <div class="project last">
                <h6>After Optimization of SQL and Visualizations</h6>
                <img src="images/Powerbi.allegion.scrnsht.historical.png" alt="" height="240" width="440" /></a> </div>
            <h3>Example 3: Shipping Dashboard</h3>
            <p>Finally, this report is used daily and viewed on a large-screen television for production 
                workers to monitor their progress throughout the workday.  
                This report was updated because it was initially hard to read without direct interaction.  
                I improved readability while reducing the need to interact directly with the report.  
                The before picture below is not the exact previous report, but the stacked bar chart and 
                confusing time legend were included similarly on the original dashboard.  
                I removed those to build a much more aesthetically pleasing dashboard. </p>
