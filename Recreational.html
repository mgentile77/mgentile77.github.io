            <p>I created this project to showcase my Python skills. 
                Speaking with my boys and determining a need they had based on a popular role-playing game, 
                I began working on this project to assist with their game creation. 
                I found that they were fond of short, episodic games, 
                but they ended up spending a lot of time just on character creation. 
                This application allows them to spend more time on playing and enjoying the storyline rather than creating players. 
                They also wanted a way to make engagements more enjoyable, 
                so I added a feature that would allow them to create a horde of enemies with varying degrees of Hit Points. 
                This makes the game more real by varying the experience of the enemies even when they are in the same monster class.</p>

            <h3>My HM Module</h3>
            <p>This will create a horde of monsters of varying HP and AC.  
                This is will add an additional dimension to game play by varying the skill level 
                and ac of monsters that may be of the same type by often attack in groups or hordes.</p>
            <p>
                Additionally, this program will assist in quickly producing new characters. 
                This is to help start game play faster for games that do not require players to start at 
                level one while still providing some variablity in character creation.</p>
